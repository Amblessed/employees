# ðŸ§ª Test Automation Strategy: Employee Management System (EMS)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To validate the functionality, security, and role-based access control of the EMS backend using automated tests across unit, integration, and API levels. The goal is to ensure reliability, maintainability, and confidence in the systemâ€™s behavior under various user roles and scenarios.

## ðŸ§± Scope of Testing

| Layer              | Focus Areas                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unit Tests         | Service logic, validation rules, exception handling                         |
| Integration Tests  | Controller-service interaction, request/response mapping                    |
| API Tests          | Role-based access, authentication, authorization, endpoint behavior         |
| Security Tests     | Access control enforcement, forbidden access, inactive user restrictions    |

## ðŸ‘¥ Roles Covered

- `ROLE_EMPLOYEE`
- `ROLE_MANAGER`
- `ROLE_ADMIN`

Each role has distinct access privileges, and tests are designed to verify both permitted and restricted actions.

## ðŸ§ª Test Types

### âœ… Unit Testing
- **Tools**: JUnit 5, Mockito
- **Focus**:
    - `EmployeeService` methods
    - Business logic (e.g., salary filters, active status)
    - Exception handling

### âœ… Integration Testing
- **Tools**: Spring Boot Test (`@WebMvcTest`, `@SpringBootTest`)
- **Focus**:
    - Controller endpoints
    - Request validation
    - Response structure

### âœ… API Testing
- **Tools**: Pytest, Requests, Allure
- **Focus**:
    - Authenticated vs unauthenticated access
    - Role-based endpoint restrictions
    - Dynamic test data from `user_details.json`
    - Parametrized test cases for scalability

### âœ… Security Testing
- **Focus**:
    - Unauthorized access returns `401`
    - Forbidden access returns `403`
    - Inactive users blocked from login and data access

---

## ðŸ“Š Reporting & Coverage

- **Allure Reports**: Visual test results with story, severity, and traceability
- **Test Logs**: Request/response traces for debugging and audit

---

## ðŸ§  Test Data Management

- Dynamic user data loaded from `user_details.json`
- Role-based filtering for test actors
- Placeholder replacement for endpoints and payloads

---

## ðŸ”„ CI/CD Integration

- GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated test runs
- Allure report publishing
- Coverage thresholds enforcement

---

## ðŸ“Œ Sample Test Scenarios

| Story                                | Role     | Expected Status | Type           |
|--------------------------------------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Manager accesses all employees       | Manager  | 200 OK           | Positive Test  |
| Employee tries to list all employees | Employee | 403 Forbidden    | Negative Test  |
| Admin deletes employee               | Admin    | 200 OK           | Positive Test  |
| Inactive user tries to access data   | Employee | 403 Forbidden    | Negative Test  |
