- **Backend**: Spring Boot with Spring Data JPA and Spring Security  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **Testing**: Pytest for comprehensive endpoint testing

By integrating Java and Python, this project demonstrates a flexible and scalable approach to backend development and testing.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Security**: Spring Security
- **Testing**: Pytest
- **Build Tool**: Maven

# 🧪 Testing with Pytest

The project includes comprehensive tests for the REST API endpoints, ensuring functionality and reliability. These tests are located in the test_endpoints.py file and cover:

- Creating new employees  
- Retrieving employee details  
- Updating employee information  
- Deleting employee records

Pytest's simplicity and powerful features make it an excellent choice for testing in a Java-Python integrated environment.

# 🔐 Security Features
Spring Security is configured to secure the API endpoints. Access control is implemented to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain operations, such as creating or deleting employee records.

# 📈 Real-World Use Case
This project serves as a practical example of integrating Java and Python in a single workflow. The backend, built with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL, provides a robust and scalable solution for managing employee data. The use of Pytest for testing demonstrates how Python can complement Java in the development process, offering flexibility and efficiency.

# 💡 Conclusion
The Employees REST API project exemplifies how combining Java and Python can lead to a powerful and flexible development workflow. By leveraging Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Pytest, this project provides a comprehensive solution for managing employee data, from backend development to testing.
