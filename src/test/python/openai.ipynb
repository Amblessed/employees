However, it's through trials - financial ruin, mental health struggles, or emotional exhaustion - that the true nature of support is revealed. Many who were once seemingly supportive may become distant. Nevertheless, these challenges highlight the consistent, unwavering support from a few, demonstrating that true loyalty isn't loud but consistently present. It's often those quietly providing assistance that prove their loyalty, while others may fail to acknowledge your struggles. Despite the associated pain, such revelations provide clarity, distinguishing between those who appreciate you for who you are and not for your riches or status. Although painful, understanding who is genuinely there for you can be powerful and insightful, even if initially cloaked in sorrow.\n",
